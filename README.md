## 📌 How It Works  
1️⃣ **User enters a message** into the classifier.  
2️⃣ **Text is preprocessed** (lowercasing, tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal).  
3️⃣ **TF-IDF Vectorizer** converts text into numerical features.  
4️⃣ **Machine Learning Model (BNB Algorithm)** predicts whether the message is **Spam or Not Spam**.  
5️⃣ **The result is displayed** in a clean, intuitive UI.
